        <h2>About Dhudhadhari Temple</h2>
        <p>Dhudhadhari Temple is a sacred place of worship in Raipur, known for its architectural beauty and religious
            significance. It serves as a spiritual retreat for devotees seeking solace and tranquility.
        <p>
            Dudhadhari temple is a Hindu temple, located at Raipur Mathpara in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh. The current Head Priest (Mahant) of the temple is Rajeshri Dr. Mahant Ramsundar Das Ji Maharaj.

            Sree Dudhdhari Math was founded by Sree Swami Balabhadradas Ji Maharaj, a monk belonging to 16th Century. As per legends Sree Swami Balabhadradas Ji Maharaj used to survive only on milk and hence came to be popularly known as Dudh Ahari Maharaj (one who consumes only milk). With the passage of time, for the sake of ease of pronunciation, the term evolved as Dudhdhari. The Math thus takes the name Dudhdhari Math.
